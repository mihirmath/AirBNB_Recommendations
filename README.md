# Covid Travel Recommendations
#### Problem
Airbnb is a popular website that allows people to rent places to stay for vacation. The user is prompted to pick their desired location, check-in and check-out dates or if they have no preferred dates. Based on the criteria, the website lists many rental homes/apartments that fit the userâ€™s criteria. However, going through the long listings is time-consuming and leaves the user guessing if their rental home is the best for them. This struggle is furthered when travelers need to book flights, restaurants, and activities at their destination.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has added another layer of complexity. The ease of travel has been a catalyst for the spread of the virus and raised concern regarding covid safety around the world. Especially when traveling internationally, there are often restrictions, mask mandates, and requirements for covid testing that people are often uneducated about, but is now essential knowledge when traveling.

#### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create covid-complying travel recommendations for home rentals, flights, activities, and restaurants. Utilizing APIs from Amadeus and Airbnb, this web app will recommend the user a personalized itinerary for their vacation. 

A secondary purpose of this project is to show a use case for the Neo4j graph database technology. Travel data lends itself well to a graph database because the data is very connected. Before gathering and loading data into the database, I created a schema to visualize the connections between the data:
